## About EarthLog

- Utilized `Tailwind CSS` for responsive web design (RWD) and resolved the issue of CSS global scope.
- Developed as a Single Page Application (`SPA`) using React for a dynamic and efficient user interface.
- To avoid re-rendering the entire subtree and prevent props drilling issues, used `Zustand` for state management.
- Leveraged `Firebase` for backend services, including database, hosting, storage and authentication.
- Utilized `Mapbox` for interactive map creation, allowing users to place markers on the globe and clearly visualize the number of destinations visited.
- Implemented `GSAP` for smooth transition animations on the landing page.
- Implemented private routes integrated with `Firebase authentication`.
- Used debounce technique to prevent saving excessive data within a short period.
